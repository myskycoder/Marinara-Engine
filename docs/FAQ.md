<summary><strong>How do I access Marinara Engine from my phone or another device?</strong></summary>
<br>

If Marinara Engine is running on one device (your PC, a server, etc.) and you want to use it from a phone, tablet, or another computer on the same network:

## 1. Make sure the server is bound to all interfaces

The shell launchers (`start.sh`, `start.bat`, `start-termux.sh`) already bind to `0.0.0.0` by default. If you started manually with `pnpm start`, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in your `.env` file first. See the [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION.md) for details.

## 2. Find your host device's local IP address

| Platform | Command                                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `ipconfig` → look for **IPv4 Address**                                  |
| macOS    | System Settings → Wi-Fi → your network, or run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` |
| Linux    | `hostname -I` or `ip addr`                                              |
| Android  | Settings → Wi-Fi → tap your network to see the IP                       |

### 3. Open a browser on the other device

Navigate to:

```
http://<host-ip>:7860
```

For example: `http://192.168.1.42:7860`

## 4. (Optional) Install the PWA

Most mobile browsers will offer an **"Add to Home Screen"** or **"Install App"** prompt, giving you a more native app experience without browser chrome.

### Not on the same network?

Tools like [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) give each device a stable IP address on a private overlay network, so you can access Marinara Engine from anywhere without exposing it to the public internet.

### Still not connecting?

- Verify both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- Check that no firewall is blocking the configured port (default `7860`).
- See the [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#app-not-loading-on-mobile--another-device) page for more help.
